Retro Top-Down Game Repo.
On this repository you will find implementations of some of my studies and researches about old-school (retro) top-down games such as:
the legenda of zelda (NES, 1986); sid meier's civilization (DOS, 1991); breath of fire (SNES, 1993); secret of mana (SNES, 1993); chrono trigger (SNES, 1995); final fantasy I, II, III, IV (NES-SNES, 1987-1991); and many more.
The objetive is to understand the concepts and implement one game following the style of the games mentioned before.
The repository is public and anyone can use it as they wish.
